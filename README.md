# Robotic hoover

A robot vacuum cleaner must reach the charging station while avoiding obstacles. The purpose of this exercise is to design and implement an efficient algorithm for deciding whether the charging station is reachable, and if so, determine the minimum number of trips required to get there and the path to follow.

The room map is described by a character matrix consisting of n rows and m columns. The robot has a footprint of 3 Ã— 3 cells, and is initially positioned in the upper left corner; the charging station is located in the lower right corner.
